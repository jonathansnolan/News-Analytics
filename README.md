An Investigation of News Analytics Data and the Impact it has Upon Volatility


The research depicted in this study focuses on examining stock volatility and its dynamics,
through various models. It also describes news analytics; how stock reacts to news reports and
could potentially be incorporated in to forecast models to intensify the modelâ€™s predictability
power. The sentiment of each news source is assigned as a numerical value in order to
incorporate it into mathematical models such as Pearson Correlations for analysis. The
wordlists which have been used to generate the numerical values of sentiment, are examined
against each other, to gain a greater understanding of their analysis results. Additionally, the
frequency of information releases is examined and implemented in Aug-GARCH models.
Overall, the main focus will be to study the influence of news reports upon stock values, in a
financial context.
